# Week 8 Assignment
## A Note on Files
The main files to focus on in this folder are:<br>
- Mini_unsupervised_P1.ipynb (the first notebook where I was trying different cleaning methods)
- Mini_unsupervised_P2.ipynb (the second notebook where I used the best techniques and finalised the model)
- mini_unsupervised_app.py (the app used for deployment this is incomplete)
<br><br>
The main CSV files to take note of are:<br>
- final_dummies_df.csv (this dataframe has been cleaned and categorised. The kmeans model results are also included.)
- final_original_df.csv (this file contains the original data with null values removed but the results of the kmeans model have been saved here as a new column)
